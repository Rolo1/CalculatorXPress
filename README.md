# CalculatorXPress
Gui desktop calculator with disk memory for transactions.
Every time that the equals sign is hit, the input is first validated, and
if the input is valid, the calculation with numbers and operators is sent 
to a line in a text file.
The original intention was a string calculator that could possibly evaluate 
an expression of several terms of numeric or constant values altogether. That
should have been possible by using either the keyboard or the device pad. Also, 
it was desired to be space-economic, using the standard math symbols(in greek).
By the time that this project was started, the developer was doing the GUI Programming course,
and the language of choice was Visual Basic, with DotNet Framework 2.0. At that time, the only requirement
was a numeric pad, an output textbox, the sum, minus, multiply and divide functions, and the equal sign.
This homework was so attractive, that I spent weeks on my free time to add several more features:
Trigonometric, exponential, logarithmic etc. Added nested expressions (parenthesis), plus the ability to 
perform steps before the result -that means grabbing several nested expressions, and reducing them to a 
simpler expression, eventually yielding the single result.
On every new achievement, the ambition to a fully fledged scientific calculator grew up, but then
new jobs and other life events made it difficult to pursue. 
It's got some placeholders for features not yet implemented, like graphics generator, so as to 
produce function graphs, the matrix solver, and polynomial evaluator.
I never found another user for reviews or feedback, so the only user (therefore cannot complain)
have been myself. Used it in my physics class to solve common problems involving circular motion,
average and dynamic speed, logarithms, and always holding my TI-36 in my other hand, solved my 
problems nitty-witty. If any missmatch was found, the class could wait until the bugs were fixed.
So, if you ever are interested in such an appliance, feel free to use it, and if you want to give 
a hand and finish the missing functions, you're welcome!
